/**
 * First thing we need is a generic idea of a measurement function or model function.
 * The model function needs to provide a way to evaluate h(x) as well as a way to 
 * differentiate h() to get its Jacobian.  In the past we've implemented a fallback 
 * option by computing the Jacobian numerically which seems to work pretty well.  This
 * Least_Squares_Model_Function should be implemented as an inherited class using the
 * curiously recurring template mechanism (CRTP) using the following syntax:
 * 
 *  class MyLeastSquaresModel : public LeastSquaresModelBase<MyLeastSquaresModel> {
 *  ...
 * 
 *  You will (at the very least) need to provide the following things in your base class:
 * 
 *  Defines a result_type that is the type returned by evaluating the functor.  Typically 
 * VectorN<float> or VectorN<double>
 * 
 * - Defines a domain_type that is the type of the search space.  Often a VectorN<foo>, but
 * can reflect other topologies if needed.
 * 
 * - Defines a jacobian_type corresponding to the space of jacobian matrices.  Typically
 *   Matrix<foo>.
 * 
 * - Defines a method: result_type operator()( domain_type const& x ) const;
 *   that evaluates the model function at the given point.
 * 
 * - The domain_type must implement a method: domain_type domain_type::operator+( gradient_type const& g ) const;
 *   that adds a tangent vector to a position.  You get this for free if both domain_type and 
 *   gradient_type are Vector<foo>.  This is where you do most of the hard work if domain_type 
 *   represents some non-trivial topological space.
 * 
 * - The result_type must implement a method: double result_type::norm_2( result_type const& g ) const;
 *   that is used in some optimizers to compute the error.  You get this for free if
 *   result_type is a Vector<foo>.
 * 
 * - The jacobian_type must implement several matrix-like methods such as scalar multiplication
 *   on the left.  You get this for free in the usual case when jacobian_type is just Matrix<foo>.
 * 
 * - In addition, depending on the application, you may want to also define:
 * 
 *     - Defines a method: jacobian_type jacobian( domain_type const& x ) const;
 *       that evaluates the jacobian of the model function at the given point.  This will 
 *       override the default implementation in this base class which computes the derivatives
 *       numerically.
